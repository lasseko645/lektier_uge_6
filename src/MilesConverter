            kilometer = kilometer + 1;      // here we make the variable kilometer go up by 1 every loop

                // this ended up not working: System.out.println(" ");    // here i make it so that if the variable is a single digit number than it will ad one space
                //so i went with this

                System.out.print(" ");    // here i make it so that if the variable is a single digit number than it will ad one space
